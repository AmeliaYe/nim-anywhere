An entrypoint for developing with NIMs that natively scales out to full-sized labs and up to production environments. NIM Anywhere is an integration of all the tooling required to start integrating NVIDIA enterprise-ready microservices.

This is great news for building a RAG architecture and easily adding NIMs as needed! If you're unfamiliar with RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation), it is an architecture that combines the AI model with a retrieval system, allowing models to pull relevant external information. Imagine you're the [xx] of a company with a local database containing confidential, up-to-date information. You donâ€™t want OpenAI to access it, but you need the model to understand it to answer questions accurately. The solution? Connect your language model to the database and feed them with the information. 

Difference with fine-tuning? Fine-tuning involves training a model on specific data to adapt it to particular tasks, permanently altering its internal parameters. In contrast, RAG dynamically retrieves relevant external information during inference without modifying the model itself, making it more flexible and scalable. RAG is also cheaper because it avoids the computational costs of retraining large models, as it only fetches information when needed rather than incorporating all data into the model.
